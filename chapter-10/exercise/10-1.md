> Assume a system where the value returned by the call sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) is 100. Assuming that the clock_t value returned by times() is an unsigned 32-bit integer, how long will it take before this value cycles so that it restarts at 0? Perform the same calculation for the CLOCKS_PER_SEC value returned by clock().

## 答案：

32位无符号整数最大为 `2^32`。所以需要 `2^32/100` s。

同理， `2^32 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC` 。
