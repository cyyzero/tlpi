/* Supplementary program for Chapter 3 */

/* syscall_speed.c

   By repeatedly invoking a simple system call (getppid()), we can get some
   idea of the cost of making system calls.

   Usage: time syscall_speed numcalls
                           Def=10000000

   Compiling with -DNOSYSCALL causes a call to a simple function
   returning an integer, which can be used to compare the overhead
   of a simple function call against that of a system call.
