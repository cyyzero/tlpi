/* child_status.c

   Demonstrate the use of wait() and the W* macros for analyzing the child
   status returned by wait()

   Usage: child_status [exit-status]

   If "exit-status" is supplied, then the child immediately exits with this
   status. If no command-line argument is supplied then the child loops waiting
   for signals that either cause it to stop or to terminate - both conditions
   can be detected and differentiated by the parent. The parent process
   repeatedly waits on the child until it detects that the child either exited
   normally or was killed by a signal.
