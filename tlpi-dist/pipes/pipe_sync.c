/* pipe_sync.c

   Show how pipes can be used for synchronizing the actions of a parent and
   multiple child processes.

   Usage: pipe_sync sleep-time...

   After creating a pipe, the program creates one child for each command-line
   argument. Each child simulates doing some work by sleeping for the number of
   seconds specified in the corresponding command-line argument. When it has
   finished doing its "work", each child closes its file descriptor for the
   write end of the pipe; the parent can see that all children have finished
   their work when it sees end-of-file on the read end of the pipe.
