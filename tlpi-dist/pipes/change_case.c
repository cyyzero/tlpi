/* Solution for Exercise 44-1 */

/* change_case.c

   Demonstrate the use of two pipes for bidirectional communication
   between a parent and child process. The parent reads text from
   standard input and sends it to the child via one of the pipes.
   The child reads text from this pipe, converts it to uppercase, and
   sends it back to the parent using the other pipe. The parent reads
   the text returned by the child and echoes it on standard output.
