/* Solution for Exercise 5-3 */

/* atomic_append.c

   Demonstrate the difference between using nonatomic lseek()+write()
   and O_APPEND when writing to a file.

   Usage: file num-bytes [x]

   The program write 'num-bytes' bytes to 'file' a byte at a time. If
   no additional command-line argument is supplied, the program opens the
   file with the O_APPEND flag. If a command-line argument is supplied, the
   O_APPEND is omitted when calling open(), and the program calls lseek()
   to seek to the end of the file before calling write(). This latter
   technique is vulnerable to a race condition, where data is lost because
   the lseek() + write() steps are not atomic. This can be demonstrated
   by looking at the size of the files produced by these two commands:

        atomic_append f1 1000000 & atomic_append f1 1000000

        atomic_append f2 1000000 x & atomic_append f2 1000000 x
