/* bad_exclusive_open.c

   The following code shows why we need the open() O_EXCL flag.

   This program tries ensure that it is the one that creates the file
   named in its command-line argument. It does this by trying to open()
   the filename once without the O_CREAT flag (if this open() succeeds
   then the program know it is not the creator of the file), and if
   that open() fails, it calls open() a second time, with the O_CREAT flag.

   If the first open() fails, the program assumes that it is the creator
   of the file. However this may not be true: some other process may have
   created the file between the two calls to open().
