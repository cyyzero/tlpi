   derives from a terminal device).

       To do this, we construct a pathname for each entry in /dev, and
       then call stat() on that pathname. This is somewhat expensive.
       The glibc implementation of ttyname() performs an optimization:
       it performs a first pass of the entries in /dev, performing
       a stat() call only if fdStat->st_ino == dent->d_ino. This speeds
       the search (since many calls to stat() are avoided), but is not
       guaranteed to work in every case (e.g., if there are symbolic
       links in /dev). Therefore, if the first pass fails to find a
       matching device, glibc's ttyname() performs a second pass
       without the st_ino check (i.e., like we do below). */
