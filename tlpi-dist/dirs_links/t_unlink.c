       size of the file created, the 'df' command executed by the second
       system() call below does may not show a change in the amount
       of disk space consumed, because the blocks of the closed file
       have not yet been freed by the kernel. If this is the case,
       then inserting a sleep(1) call here should be sufficient to
       ensure that the the file blocks have been freed by the time
       of the second 'df' command.
