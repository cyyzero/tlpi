/* us_xfr_v2_sv.c

   An example UNIX stream socket server. Accepts incoming connections and
   copies data sent from clients to stdout. This program is similar to
   us_xfr_sv.c, except that it uses the functions in unix_sockets.c to
   simplify working with UNIX domain sockets.

   See also us_xfr_v2_cl.c.
