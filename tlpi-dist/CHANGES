This file summarizes the changes that have been made since publication
to the program examples printed in "The Linux Programming Interface".
Background on some of these changes can be found in the online errata
for TLPI, available at http://man7.org/tlpi/errata/.

2010-11-13
        sockets/us_abstract_bind.c
                The code was improved as per the errata for page 1176.

2011-01-17
        timers/real_timer.c
                A mistake in the ordering of the code in main() was fixed.
                See the erratum for page 483.

2011-02-17
        psem/thread_incr_psem.c
                Fixed an error in a comment. See the erratum for page 1102.

2011-04-05
        threads/thread_multijoin.c.
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 649.
        threads/prod_condvar.c
                Fixed a race condition. The problem was similar to that
                described in the erratum for page 649.
        threads/prod_no_condvar.c
                Fixed a race condition. The problem was similar to that
                described in the erratum for page 649.

2011-04-19
        altio/demo_sigio.c
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 1349.
        daemons/daemon_SIGHUP.c
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 774.

2011-05-18
        signals/t_kill.c
                Fixed an error in a diagnostic message. See the erratum
                for page 406.

2011-07-06
        Makefile
                Added missing "memalloc" to the directory list.
        memalloc/free_and_sbrk.c
                Added feature test macro definition (_BSD_SOURCE).
                See the erratum for page 142.

2011-08-11
        acl/acl_view.c
                Fixed a small bug as per the erratum for page 336.

2011-09-04
        pipes/popen_glob.c
        procexec/make_zombie.c
        sockets/inet_sockets.c
                Removed an unnecessary assignment statement that added
                a terminating null byte to the string buffer output by
                snprintf().  See the erratum for page 555.

2011-12-05
        dirs_links/t_unlink.c
                Added a comment referring to the erratum for page 348.

2011-12-06
        pty/unbuffer.c
                Change parent exit status when read() returns <= 0
                from EXIT_FAILURE to EXIT_SUCCESS.

2011-12-13
        signals/catch_rtsigs.c
                Restore 3 lines that were accidentally omitted at the
                end of this program. See the erratum for page 463.

2011-12-31
        threads/thread_incr.c
                Make global variable 'glob' volatile, so that the program
                more easily produces "incorrect" behavior, even in the face
                of compiler optimizations. See the erratum for page 632.

2012-02-16
        lib/alt_functions.c
                Fix indentation in ALT_posix_openpt().

2012-04-03
        lib/Makefile
        lib/Build_ename.sh
                Refactor, so that Build_ename.sh produces output on stdout,
                rather than to a named file.

2012-04-06
        lib/itimerspec_from_str.c
                Conditionally make the content of this file empty if
                compiling on MacOSX, since that operating system doesn't
                define the 'itimerspec' structure.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        Makefile.inc.MacOSX
                Remove '-lrt' from the IMPL_LDLIBS definition, since there
                is no librt on MacOSX.

2012-05-04
        fileio/seek_io.c
                Fix a typo in comment at top of the program.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2012-05-11
        psem/Makefile
                Correct the makefile to use "cc -pthreads" for POSIX
                semaphores. Formerly, the makefile used "cc -lrt", but
                recent toolchain changes mean that that this no longer works
                ("cc -pthreads" always worked.) See the erratum for page 1061.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)
        pshm/Makefile
                Correct a bug in the makefile that caused link errors.
                (Formerly, the makefile worked, but this was fortuitous;
                recent toolchain changes revealed the bug.)

2012-05-13
        pshm/README
                Fix a wordo.

2012-05-20
        README
                Various small fixes.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-05-25
        BUILDING
                Various small fixes.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-05-26
        memalloc/free_and_sbrk.c
                Fix an error in the code comments at the top of the program.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-05-31
        svmsg/svmsg_info.c
        svsem/svsem_info.c
        svshm/svshm_info.c
                Eliminate unnecessary inclusion of <sys/ipc.h> header file.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-06-05
        COPYING
                Renamed to COPYING.agpl-v3
        Added new files:
                COPYING.gpl-v3
                        Copy of the GNU General Public License, version 3
                COPYING.lgpl-v3
                        Copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3
        lib/*
                Changed the license of the library functions in the /lib
                directory to GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.
        sockets/read_line_buf.c
        sockets/read_line_buf.h
                Created links for the sockets/read_line_buf.{c,h} files in the
                lib/ directory, so that these files are licensed LGPLv3.

        README
                Updated to note the licensing of the library functions.

2012-07-05
        filesys/t_statfs.c
        filesys/t_statvfs.c
                Changed several printf() statements to use unsigned types for
                various fields, since (in the case of the 'statvfs' structure at
                least) these fields are specified as unsigned in SUSv[34].
                (The 'statfs' structure isn't covered by SUSv[34], but using 
                unsigned types seems reasonable and safe.)

2012-07-22
        filelock/create_pid_file.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        procexec/execlp.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
        svshm/svshm_xfr_reader.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        sysinfo/procfs_pidmax.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        threads/one_time_init.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.

2012-07-26
        filebuff/direct_read.c
                Fix an error in comment describing program arguments.
                (Thanks to Jason Orendorff.)
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2012-08-03
        loginacct/dump_utmpx.c
        loginacct/utmpx_login.c
        loginacct/view_lastlog.c
                Remove unneeded casts.
                See the errata for pages 824, 829, and 831.

2012-09-10
        loginacct/dump_utmpx.c
                Fix error introduced in 2012-08-03 changes.
        altio/epoll_input.c
                Improve a comment.
                See the erratum for page 1363.

2012-09-27
        svsem/Makefile
                Fixed a bug in the Makefile that causes svsem_demo.c
                not to be built.
                (Thanks to Jinnan Wang.)

2012-09-30
        timers/real_timer.c
                Use NULL instead of 0 for last argument of setitimer() call.
                See the erratum for page 484.
                (Thanks to Trevor Woerner.)

2012-10-02
        Makefile.inc
                Add "-Wno-unused-but-set-variable" to compiler flags
                (the IMPL_CFLAGS macro), to prevent compilation warnings
                in three of the example programs.  (Those warnings do not
                correspond to real problems in the code.) The
                "-Wunused-but-set-variable" flag was added (and turned on
                by default) in GCC 4.6, which was released on 2011-03-35
                (i.e., after TLPI was written).

2012-10-15
        loginacct/dump_utmpx.c
        loginacct/utmpx_login.c
        loginacct/view_lastlog.c
                Revert the changes of 2012-08-03. These were made overlooking
                the fact that in the 'utmpx' structure, 'tv_sec' is defined as
                being of type 'int32_t', not 'time_t', so that the 2012-08-03
                changes in fact cause warnings on 64-bit systems.
                As a consequence, three (as yet unapplied) errata
                for pages 824, 829, and 831 are removed.

2012-10-18
        procexec/demo_clone.c
                Minor fix to a comment (s/will affect/may affect/).
                Declare the variable that holds return status of write()
                as 'ssize_t'.
                (Thanks to Trevor Woerner.)

2012-12-17
        sockets/i6d_ucase_sv.c
                Fix typo in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
                (Thanks to Kanak Kshetri.)
        sockets/i6d_ucase_cl.c
                Fix typo in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2012-12-24
        procexec/demo_clone.c
                Add a comment at the top of the program clarifying that the
                user must select a valid set of flags for the clone() call.
                (Thanks to Jeffrey Thompson.)

2013-01-02
        altio/poll_pipes.c
                Fix typos in two errExit() string arguments.
                See the erratum for page 1340.

2013-02-11
        sockets/id_echo_sv.c
                Remove unneeded use of the variable 'addrlen'.
                See the erratum for page 1241.

2013-03-09
        procpri/sched_set.c
                Fix a bug in the handling of the command-line arguments.
                See the erratum for page 743.

2013-03-10
        procpri/Makefile
                Move demo_sched_fifo from GEN_EXE to LINUX_EXE.

                Remove demo_timerfd from GEN_EXE target.
                (Thanks to Antonio Jose Rodrigues.)

2013-03-11
        sysinfo/t_uname.c
                Make definition of _GNU_SOURCE conditional on __linux__.
                See the erratum for page 230.

2013-03-18
        threads/detached_attrib.c
                Fix a typo in a string:
                        errExitEN(s, "pthread_attr_getdetachstate");
                    ==>
                        errExitEN(s, "pthread_attr_setdetachstate");

                Interestingly, this error was not present in the printed
                version of the code (page 628 of TLPI).
                (Thanks to Kanak Kshetri.)

2013-04-05
        svmsg/Makefile
                Fix a typo that meant that 'svmsg_send' was not compiled.
                (Thanks to George Yoshida.)

2013-06-05

                Fix error-handling code for usage diagnostic.
                See the erratum for page 317.

2013-07-11
        timers/itimerspec_from_str.c
                Change itimerspecFromStr() so that it does not modify
                its string argument.
                See the errata for pages 502 and 503.

2013-09-13
        procexec/acct_on.c
                Add missing argument to the call to usageErr();
                See the erratum for page 592.
                (Thanks to Liu Jiaming.)

2013-09-17
        mmap/mmcopy.c
                Correct argument pasted to msync() (s/src/dst/).
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2013-09-18
        filebuff/write_bytes.c
                Minor to changes to comments at top of the program.
        filebuff/Makefile
                Add entries to produce the non-vanilla flavors of the
                write_bytes program:
                    write_bytes_fdatasync  (do fdatasync() after each write)
                    write_bytes_fsync      (do fsync() after each write)
                    write_bytes_o_fsync    (open the file with O_SYNC)

2013-09-22
        procpri/t_setpriority.c
                Fix typo in a diagnostic message.
                See the erratum for page 737.

2013-09-23
        procpri/demo_sched_fifo.c
                s/useCPU("child ")/useCPU("parent")/ near the end of
                the program.
                (Thanks to Liu Jiaming.)

2013-09-23

                warnings that are produced when compiling code that

                with reference to code examples that addess this point.
