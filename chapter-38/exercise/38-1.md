> Log in as a normal, unprivileged user, create an executable file (or copy an existing file such as /bin/sleep), and enable the set-user-ID permission bit on that file (chmod u+s). Try modifying the file (e.g., cat >> file). What happens to the file permissions as a result (ls –l)? Why does this happen?

当文件被非特权用户修改后，内核会清除文件上的 `set-user-ID` 权限位。这么做是为了防止修改这些程序的同时还保留一些特权。
